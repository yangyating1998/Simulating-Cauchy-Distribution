# Simulating-Cauchy-Distribution
Cauchy Distribution, having "UNDEFINED" mean

## Packages & Modules
This project uses two ways to simulate cauchy distribution with parameters 0 and 1.
- np.random.cauchy
- np.random.standard_cauchy

## Math Info
Cauchy distribution
- undefined mean
- often used in "pathological" - continuous everywhere, differentiable nowhere.
- also the distribution of two things' ratio

## Analysis
Different graph?
- Cauchy distribution has fatty tails
- "np.cauchy" is influenced heavily by the OUTLIERS!
