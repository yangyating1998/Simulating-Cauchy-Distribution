# Simulating-Cauchy-Distribution
Cauchy Distribution, having "UNDEFINED" mean

## Packages & Modules
This project uses two **numpy modules** to simulate cauchy distribution with parameters 0 and 1.
- 

## Math Info
Cauchy distribution
- undefined mean
- often used in "pathological" - continuous everywhere, differentiable nowhere.
- also the distribution of two things' ratio

## Analysis
Different graph?
- Cauchy distribution has fatty tails
- The normal ==np.cauchy== didn't
